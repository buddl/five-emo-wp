# five-emo-wp
Wordpress Plugin for 5 Emotions

 You can simply add 5 Emotions as a widget into wordpress.
 The simple mode is 'popup'. This mode only adds a social button,
 that opens a popup window when clicked.
 The more common mode is 'iframe' . Here a frame is embedded as a widget,
 showing the 5 emotions directly on your page.
 Another mode is 'kiosk'. This mode is suitable, if you want to present
 your website on a public place, in a shop or on a touch screen.
 All you need for this is an object ID you get on our website.
